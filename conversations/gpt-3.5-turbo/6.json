Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.\",\n        \"Sorcerous Origin - Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\",\n        \"Wind Speaker - The arcane magic you command is infused with elemental air. You can speak, read, and write Primordial. Knowing this language allows you to understand and be understood by those who speak its dialects: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.\",\n        \"Spellcasting - An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing\u00a0for the sorcerer\u00a0spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table. Spell Slots The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\"\n    ],\n    \"spells\": [\n        \"Levitate - One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range. When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.\"\n    ],\n    \"racial_traits\": [\n        \"Speed - Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\",\n        \"Ability Score Increase - Your Constitution score increases by 2.\",\n        \"Languages - You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial.

As a noble Air Genasi sorcerer, you have a natural affinity for the element of air. You possess the ability to use Tempestuous Magic, allowing you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, as well as the Wind Speaker feature, which grants you the ability to speak, read, and write Primordial.\n\nWith your proficiency in History, Deception, Perception, and Persuasion, you have a keen eye for detail and are adept at both uncovering secrets and navigating social situations. You are equipped with a crossbow, light, dagger, quarterstaff, and a playing card set, giving you a mix of ranged and melee options.\n\nYour chosen spell, Levitate, allows you to manipulate gravity, lifting creatures or objects up to 500 pounds off the ground and suspending them in mid-air. As an independent and self-reliant individual, you value your freedom, and your chaotic alignment reflects your desire to prove yourself without relying on your noble background.\n\nYou have connections to your family, and winning their approval is of utmost importance to you. With your eloquent flattery, you excel at making others feel important and valued. However, your flaw lies in thinking that the world revolves around you.\n\nNow that you're prepared, what would you like to do in the eerie city of Sharn?"
