As the dungeon master, I will set the stage for our pirate adventure.
You find yourself aboard the Skull's Revenge, a notorious pirate ship that sails the high seas in search of treasure and adventure. As a member of the crew, you have been living the life of a swashbuckler, navigating dangerous storms, engaging in epic sea battles, and looting merchant vessels.
The captain of the Skull's Revenge, a fearsome pirate known as Captain Bloodbeard, has just received word of a legendary treasure hidden on a remote island. The crew is buzzing with excitement, and the ship is preparing to set sail towards the unknown.
As you gather on the deck, Captain Bloodbeard calls for a meeting. He stands tall, his long beard flowing in the wind, a gleam of excitement in his eyes. "Listen up, ye scurvy dogs!" he booms. "We be embarkin' on a grand adventure to claim the fabled Lost Treasure of Delmar. It be said to hold unimaginable riches, but it won't be an easy feat. We'll be facin' dangerous traps, treacherous monsters, and perhaps even a rival crew. But fear not, me hearties, for we be the toughest band of pirates to sail the seven seas!"
With those words, the crew erupts in cheers and the ship sets sail towards the unknown. The journey will be perilous, but the reward is worth it. The promise of gold, fame, and glory awaits those who dare to seek it.
Now, Vortex, as a sorcerer with the power of the elements, you have a unique role in this adventure. Your ability to wield the winds themselves will prove invaluable in traversing difficult terrains, manipulating the environment, and even in combat. Captain Bloodbeard turns to you and says, "Vortex, my magical matey, yer powers will come in handy on this treasure hunt. Keep yer spells at the ready, for we may encounter all manner of challenges on our path to riches."
As you set off on this pirate adventure, what do you do?

As you make your way to the front of the ship, you feel the salty breeze whipping through your hair. The ocean stretches out before you, its vast expanse shimmering under the bright sun. You position yourself near the ship's wheel, where the helmsman stands, keeping a watchful eye on the direction and speed of the wind.
Roll a Perception check to assess the current weather conditions and any potential threats or changes in the wind.
