Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. The “Quick Build” section for your character's class offers suggestions on which scores to increase. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can't raise any of your scores above 20.",

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast gust of wind with this trait (choose when you select this race)."
